A simple code to spread points as evenly as possible on a sphere.  

Each point is given a charge, then the system evolves in a dynamics until reaching equilibrium.

Note that in most cases, due to mathematics,  points won't be perfectly spread on the sphere with equal spacing. 
Only points that can form regular polyhedra can achieve perfectly equal distribution.

This code is used to generate the initial structure of water clusters.
