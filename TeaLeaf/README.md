This is my OpenACC porting for TeaLeaf mini-app.   

This particular version of TeaLeaf is written in Fortran, 
and is derived from https://github.com/UK-MAC/TeaLeaf_ref.
The code has been ported to many different programming models, and turns out OpenACC was missing. 
I ported this as a candidate for an ongoing benchmark development.  


Note that TeaLeaf is also available in C : https://github.com/UoB-HPC/TeaLeaf
